     <h1> A day of a skater </h1>
     <p> It's a normal day <br>
         So lets do it a extreme day <br>
         Playing my skate, makes my day <br>
         Playing with gadgets, no that's not a day <br>
         This is a skateboard date, I don't neeed girl date <br>
         Trought these rought and cracked sreet. <br>
         Seems to remind me of life strugles and dispares. <br>
         But just like my skateboard that keeps going foward with every push I take. <br>
         I see know that no matter how big a problem, you got to keep pushing. <br>
         For the road is everlasting, but its time we dont have so just keep. <br>
         Pushing. <br>
